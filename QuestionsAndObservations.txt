Q1: How does the program detect that the component will not fit in the container?
- Does it happen when targetWidth > remWidth || targetHeight > remHeight? 
- Any boolean to detect?

Q2:Why do we sort the components with the area in decreasing order?  (Floorplan.cc 499) 
- So far the examples only have 1 item for each bagLayout.
- Bubble Sort is the sorting algorithm used here.

O1: ARInRange has the following functions:
a) Verify the targetAR is in-between minAR and maxAR. 
b) If exceeded, correct it to min or max.
c) If AR and maxAR are of opposite sides of 1, swap the height and width and invert both maxAR and minAR.
- Overall, it allows the program to verify the component is layed out within the acceptable AR range.
- It's called only at FPCompWrapper::layout.
- The size of the FPCompWrapper unit is then re-defined if there's a change in AR.

Q3: What does recalcSize do? (Floorplan.cc 550)
- The comment says "it goes through the layout components and find the containers width and height".
- Potential answer: it sets the the new size for the bagLayout container after laying out all the components to the bagLayout.


O2: Comment (Floorplan.cc 868)
- "This assumes a component has an area.  For a container, it will not have an area until it gets layed out.:

Q4: "print name" && "print comp->getName()" (gdb with String) for the component doesn't work properly.
- We can only see the name of the container, but not the component.

O3: Variable watches are sometimes not accurate for undeclared/initialized values.
